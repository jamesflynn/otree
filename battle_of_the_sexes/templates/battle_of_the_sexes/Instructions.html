        Instructions
    </h3>

    <p>
        In this study, you will be paired randomly and anonymously with another participant. One of you will be
        randomly designated Husband and the other will be designated Wife. Prior to making a decision, you will
        learn your role.
    </p>

    <p>
        Both Husband and Wife have two choices for an eveningâ€™s entertainment. Each can either go to a football
        match or to an opera. Husband prefers football and Wife prefers opera; however, to both it is more important
        that they go out together than that each see the preferred entertainment.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each of you must independently and simultaneously make a decision. Your payoffs will be determined by both
        choices as shown below:
