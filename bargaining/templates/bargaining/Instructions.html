    <p>
        You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant.
        There are {{ Constants.amount_shared }} for you to divide.
        Both of you have to simultaneously and independently demand a portion
        of the {{ Constants.amount_shared }} for yourselves. If the sum of your
        demands is smaller or equal to {{ Constants.amount_shared }}, both of
        you get what you demanded. If the sum of your demands is larger
        than {{ Constants.amount_shared }},
        both of you get nothing.
