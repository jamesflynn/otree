<p>Next tell us the bid you would make on your application to managers for the same job (95% accuracy, 5 pages just like the one above). This will help speed up the hiring process, and will reduce time wasted if the fit isn't right for a particular job. </p>

<p>Managers will have a fixed budget per person. Please keep in mind that <strong>managers may select you based on this bid.</strong> Managers <strong>will start with this information to negotiate a price for your services.</strong>   Note, we will audit 1 in 10 transcripts at random, and in those cases we will only pay where accuracy is over 95%. </p>

<p>About 25% of the time we will hire you directly at your initial bid.</P>

<p>What bid will you submit to the manager for transcribing 5 pages of the example at 95% accuracy? Note, we will audit 1 in 10 transcripts at random, and in those cases we will only pay if 95% accuracy is achieved.  </p>
