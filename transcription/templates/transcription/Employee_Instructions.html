<h3>You are an Employee</h3>
<p>There are 4 MTurkers simultaneously assigned to this group. You, two other employees - who will be offered to carry out a transcription task for extra (bonus) money, and a manager. Each worker can transcribe up to 5 pages of a scanned text table, for a price you negotiate with the manager. You will be paid for every completed page by MTurk bonus</p>

<p>First we'll ask you a few questions. Then you will interact with other participants. If no one shows up to the chat room, or you want to quit the transcription select the 'quit' checkbox before you hit Next, and we will end the HIT and pay you for the HIT only.</p>
