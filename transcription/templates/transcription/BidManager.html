<p>FYI, below are the instructions we give employees to make their bids. These bids will be shown to you:</p>

<div class="instructions well well-lg">
<p>Next tell us the bid you would make on your application to managers for 5 pages just like the one above, transcribed at 95% accuracy. This will help speed up the hiring process, and will reduce time wasted if the fit isn't right for a particular job. </p>

<p>Managers will have a fixed budget per person. Please keep in mind that managers <strong>will start with this information to negotiate a price for your services.</strong> We will audit some transcripts at random, and in those cases we will only pay where accuracy is over 95%.</p>
