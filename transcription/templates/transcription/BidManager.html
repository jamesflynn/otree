<p>
	<strong>FYI:</strong> Below are the instructions we give <strong>employees</strong> to make their bids.</p>
<p>
	<strong>These are not your instructions, they are the instructions given to the employees you are managing.</strong>
	The resulting employee bids will be shown to you.
</p>

<div class="instructions well well-lg">
<h3>Employees</h3>
<p>Next tell us the bid you would make on your application to managers, per page, for up to 5 pages just like the example, transcribed at 95% accuracy.  We only need the numbers in the table, none of the column or row headings. This will help speed up the hiring process, and will reduce time wasted if the fit isn't right for a particular job. </p>

<p>Managers will have a fixed budget per page. Please keep in mind that managers <strong>will start with this information to negotiate a price for your services.</strong> We will audit some transcripts at random, and in those cases we will only pay where accuracy is over 95%.</p>
