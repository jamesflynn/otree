<p>You are the Manager. After this page you will chat with the employee.<br><small>(The information below is repeated on the chat page for your reference.)</small></p>

<p>You have a maximum budget of <strong>{{ budget }} per page </strong>and a {{ basepay }} base payment per page. The employee was not aware of your budget when they bid. Your task is to negotiate a wage with the employee. After chatting with you the employee will be taken to a screen to transcribe scanned pages, which will be checked for accuracy.  For each page completed above 95% accuracy, they will receive the wage you negotiate and you will receive the difference between the agreed wage and {{ budget }}. If you are unable to come to an agreement, or if the work is not submitted with at least 95% accuracy within 48 hours, the worker will not be paid for that page, and you will receive only the {{ basepay }} base payment per page.</p>

<p>You must agree to a wage with the worker in the chat room and both of you must indicate the same wage upon exiting the chat room in order to be paid.</p>

<p>However, if you agree to a wage over {{ kickin }}, you have to start to give back the {{ basepay }} base payment.  We calculate the amount you give back by assessing a {{ rate }}% tax for all wages above {{ kickin }}. 

<p>For example if you agree on $4.50, you will pay back $1.00 from the base rate of {{ basepay }}, leaving you with a payment of $0.50 from the budget, plus $1.00 remaining of the base payment. Note that this tax only applies to wages over {{ kickin }}. If you agree to pay a worker {{ budget }}, you will have to completely pay back your initial payment, and you will receive no money per completed page. Do not agree to a wage above {{ budget }}. </p>


<p>Below is the relationship between the wage you agree to and the amount you get:</p>

<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Wage Agreed To Per Page</th>
      <th scope="col">Your Final Pay Per Page</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">$3.00</th>
      <td>$4.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">$3.50</th>
      <td>$3.50</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">$4.00</th>
      <td>$3.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">$4.25</th>
      <td>$2.25</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">$4.50</th>
      <td>$1.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">$4.75</th>
      <td>    {% formfield player.test_compre_pr label="What would you be paid per page?" %}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">$5.00</th>
      <td>$0.00</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>If you are unable to come to a wage agreement with the worker, you will still be paid to complete the HIT and receive your base payment of {{ basepay }} per page for 5 pages. </p>
