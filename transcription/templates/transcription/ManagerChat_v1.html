<p>You are the Manager. {% if split_chats %}Please chat with the 3 Employees below in the 3 chat windows.{% else %}Please chat with the 3 employees below.{% endif %} They should be there now.</p>
<p>You have a maximum budget of <strong>$5 per page</strong>. The employees were not aware of your budget when they bid. Please <strong>confirm each employee's bid amount in the chat window</strong> and accept any that were <strong>$5 or less.</strong> If, and only if, the worker agrees to the <strong>original bid</strong> will the budget be split between you accordingly. You are not able to negotiate.
    
<p>After this chat employees will be taken to a screen to transcribe scanned pages, which will be checked for accuracy.  For each page completed above 95% accuracy, they will receive their bid and you will receive the difference between $5 and the confirmed price.  If the work is not submitted, or does not achieve at least 95% accuracy, no one will be paid for that page. For example, if you confirm $4 per page for all three workers, who then complete the work, you will be paid: ($5-$4) x (3 people) x (5 pages each) = $15</p>

<p>If some of the employees bid too high, you can still profit from your other agreements, and you will still be paid for the HIT. Decline bids above your $5 budget. Do not renegotiate.</p>
