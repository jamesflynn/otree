<h3>You are a Manager</h3>
<p>There are 4 MTurkers simultaneously assigned to this group. You and three employees who will carry out a transcription task. Each worker can transcribe up to 5 pages of a scanned text image. We have a budget of $5 per completed page, and whatever we don't pay to workers we will pay to you (through an MTurk bonus)</p>

<p>This is unlikely to take more than 25 minutes, and managers earn - on average, $10 for this.</p>

<p>First we'll ask you a few questions. Then you will interact with other participants. If no one shows up, or you want to quit for any other reason, you can withdraw from the survey. If you choose to terminate prematurely (before completing the negotiation) just hit Next, and we will end the HIT and pay you for the HIT only.</p>
