<p>You are the Manager. Please chat with the employee. They are here now.</p>

<p>You have a maximum budget of <strong>${{ budget }} per page.</strong> The employee was not aware
of your budget when they bid. Please <strong>confirm the employee's bid
amount in the chat window</strong> and <strong>accept</strong> any that were <strong>${{ budget }} or less</strong>.

<p>After this chat the employee will be taken to a screen to transcribe scanned pages, which will be checked for accuracy.  For each page completed above 95% accuracy, they will receive their bid and you will receive the difference between ${{ budget }} and the bid. If the work is not submitted, or does not achieve at least 95% accuracy, neither of you will be paid for that page.</p>

<p><strong>However, your share of the budget will be taxed at {{ rate }}% of the amount you pay over ${{ kickin }} per page.</strong> For example if you agree on ${{ kickin_plus20 }}, you will pay a ${{ rate20 }} tax, leaving you with ${{ eresult }} instead of ${{ instead }}</p>

<p>If the employee bids too high, you will still be paid to complete the HIT. Decline bids above the ${{ budget }} budget.
</p>

<p>If the bid goes over ${{ limit }} but stays under ${{ budget }} the employee will be paid, but your share will be zero.</p>
