<p>The employees are all here, their initial bids were:</p>

<div class="instructions well well-lg">
Employee 1 : <span id="e1">{{player.get_employee1.bid}}</span> for each page<br>
Employee 2 : <span id="e2">{{player.get_employee2.bid}}</span> for each page<br>
Employee 3 : <span id="e3">{{player.get_employee3.bid}}</span> for each page
</div>

<p>Negotiate with the employees and enter the agreed-to amount (per page) in the corresponding box below. Remember, we will pay out $5 for every page that is completed at >95% accuracy, up to $25 for the 5 pages. So for any per-page bids less than $5, we'll give the rest of the money to you.</p>

<p>Example: You and an employee agree to $3.50 per page, and the employee completes 3 pages.</p>
<p>In this case the employee will be paid 3 x $3.50 = $10.50 and you will be paid the rest of the $5 budget for each completed page: $4.50</p>
