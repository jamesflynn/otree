<h3>You are a Manager</h3>

<p>You have a fixed budget of <strong>$5 per page</strong>. Part of that will cover the wages to the transcribers, and you can keep the remainder.</p>

<p>After this chat workers will be directed to a screen to transcribe scanned pages, which will be evaluated for accuracy.  For each page completed above 95% accuracy, you will receive the difference between $5 and the price you agreed to with that person.  For example, if you agree to $4 per page for all three workers, who then complete the work, you will be paid: ($5-$4) x (3 people) x (5 pages each) = $15</p>

<p>If you fail to agree to a price with one or more workers, you can still profit from your other agreements, and you will still be paid for the HIT.</p>

<p>You and the employees are all here now, their initial bids were:</p>

<div class="instructions well well-lg">
Employee 1 : {{ bid2 }} for each page<br>
Employee 2 : {{ bid3 }} for each page<br>
Employee 3 : {{ bid4 }} for each page
</div>

<h3>Chat Room:</h3>
  {% chat nickname="Manager" channel=Subsession %}
<br>
<p>Enter the agreed-to per-page amounts here (enter 0 if no deal is reached).</p>

  If there is a discrepancy between what you enter and what the employee enters, then NEITHER party will receive any additional bonus for work completed. Please make sure you agree!

    <p><b>You and the employees MUST AGREE on their per-page price before you proceed!</b> This will end your HIT, you cannot come back.</b> You will receive any payment owed via an MTurk Bonus</p>
