<p>You have been assigned to be the manager, to negotiate with 3 workers. Your budget is $5 per worker. You will decide how to split the budget between you by negotiating. If you reach an agreement, your payoff is {{ budget }} minus the price that you agree to. The worker will receive the price you agree to minus a random tax that only they know.  If you do not reach an agreement with a particular worker, you will not receive any of your budget for that worker, and that worker will not receive additional payments.</p>

<p>This means if you agree to a wage of $4 with one worker and a wage of $3 with another, the first worker will receive $4 minus their tax, the second worker will receive $3 minus their tax. You will receive $1 from the first worker ($5 - $4), and $2 from the second worker ($5 - $3).</p>

<p>This means that the maximum you should pay any worker is {{ budget }}.</p>

<p>The opening offer from the employees are:<br>
 Employee 1 : {{ bid2 }}<br>
 Employee 2 : {{ bid3 }}<br>
 Employee 3 : {{ bid4 }}</p>
