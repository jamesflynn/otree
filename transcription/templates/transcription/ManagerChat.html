<p>You are the Manager. Please chat with the 3 employees below. They should be here now.</p>
<p>You have a maximum budget of <strong>$5 per page.</strong> The employees were not aware
of your budget when they bid. Please <strong>confirm each employee's bid
amount in the chat window</strong> and <strong>accept</strong> any that were <strong>$5 or less</strong>.

<p>After this chat employees will be taken to a screen to transcribe scanned pages, which will be checked for accuracy.  For each page completed above 95% accuracy, they will receive their bid and you will receive the difference between $5 and the confirmed price. If the work is not submitted, or does not achieve at least 95% accuracy, no one will be paid for that page. For example, if you confirm $4 per page for all three workers, who then complete the work, you will be paid: ($5-$4) x (3 people) x (5 pages each) = $15</p>

<p>If some of the employees bid too high, you can still profit from your other agreements, and you will still be paid for the HIT. Decline bids above your $5 budget. Do not renegotiate.
