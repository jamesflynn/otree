<h3>You are a Manager</h3>
<p>You and the employees are all here, their initial bids were:</p>

<div class="instructions well well-lg">
Employee 1 : <span id="e1">{{ bid2 }}</span> for each page<br>
Employee 2 : <span id="e2">{{ bid3 }}</span> for each page<br>
Employee 3 : <span id="e3">{{ bid4 }}</span> for each page
</div>

<p>We will pay $5 per page of transcribed text. After this chat session the employees will be taken to a page to start transcribing up to 5 pages of text. (They don't have to do it right away, they can do it any time in the next 48 hours)</p>

<p>We will pay the employees for those pages with an MTurk bonus</p>

<p><strong>If you negotiate a lower per-page price than $5, any money left over, we will give to you, the manager.</strong></p>

<p>For example, you agree to the following per-page rates:<br>Employee #1: $3, Employee #2: $4, Employee #3: $4.50. If they complete the 5 pages, you will receive a bonus of 5 x ($2 + $1 + $0.50) = $17.50</p>
