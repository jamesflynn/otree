<p><strong>All payoffs are real. You will be paid via an MTurk bonus.</strong></p>

<p>You have been assigned to be the Manager, to negotiate with 3 Workers. Your budget is {{ budget }} per Worker.</p>
<p>Your payoff will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>{{ budget }} - (the wage you agree to pay Worker 1)</li>
<li>+</li>
<li>{{ budget }} - (the wage you agree to pay Worker 2)</li>
<li>+</li>
<li>{{ budget }} - (the wage you agree to pay Worker 3)</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Each worker will receive the wage you and that Worker agree to.</li>
</ul>

<p>But each worker has been randomly assigned a tax between $2 and $4.</p>

<p>The Workers do not know your budget. They only know it is between $3 and $5.</p>

<p>If you don't agree with a Worker you will still receive the payoff from the agreements with the other workers.</p>

<p>If any Workers don't show up you can still click through to finish the HIT.</p>
