<p>You are the Manager. Please chat with the employee. They are here now.</p>
<p>You have a maximum budget of <strong>$5 per page.</strong> The employee was not aware
of your budget when they bid. Please <strong>confirm the employee's bid
amount in the chat window</strong> and <strong>accept</strong> any that were <strong>$5 or less</strong>.

<p>After this chat the employee will be taken to a screen to transcribe scanned pages, which will be checked for accuracy.  For each page completed above 95% accuracy, they will receive their bid and you will receive the difference between $5 and the confirmed price. If the work is not submitted, or does not achieve at least 95% accuracy, neither of you will be paid for that page. For example, if you confirm $4 per page, and the work is completed, you will be paid: ($5-$4) x (5 pages each) = $5</p>

<p>If the employee bids too high, you will still be paid to complete the HIT. Decline bids above your $5 budget. Do not renegotiate.
