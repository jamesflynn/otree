<p>You are the Manager. {% if split_chats %}Please chat with the 3 Employees below in the 3 chat windows.{% else %}Please chat with the 3 employees below.{% endif %} They should be there now.</p>


<!--<p>You have a maximum budget of <strong>$9 per page</strong>. The employees were not aware of your budget when they bid. Please <strong>confirm each employee's bid amount in the chat window</strong> and accept any that were <strong>$9 or less.</strong> If, and only if, the employee agrees to the <strong>original bid</strong> will the budget be split between you accordingly. You are not able to negotiate.
    
<p>After this chat employees will be taken to a screen to transcribe scanned pages, which will be checked for accuracy.  For each page completed above 95% accuracy, they will receive their bid and you will receive the difference between $9 and the confirmed price.  If the work is not submitted, or does not achieve at least 95% accuracy, no one will be paid for that page. For example, if you confirm $4 per page for all three employees, who then complete the work, you will be paid: ($9-$4) x (3 people) x (5 pages each) = $75</p>

<p>If some of the employees bid too high, you can still profit from your other agreements, and you will still be paid for the HIT. Decline bids above your $9 budget. Do not renegotiate.</p>

-->
<p>You have a maximum budget of <strong>$9 per page</strong>. The employees were not aware of your budget when they bid. <strong>Your job is to negotiate a wage for each employee</strong>. Wages can be the same or different for different employees. You can negotiate however you want. If, and only if, you and the employee agree to a wage will the budget be split between you accordingly. </p>
<p>After this chat, employees will be taken to a screen to transcribe scanned pages, which will be checked for accuracy.  For each page completed above 95% accuracy, they will receive their bid and you will receive the difference between $9 and the wage you agree to with that worker.  If the work is not submitted, or does not achieve at least 95% accuracy, no one will be paid for that page. For example, if you agree to $6 per page for all three workers, who then complete the work, you will be paid: ($9-$6) x (3 people) x (5 pages each) = $45</p>

<p><strong>You do not have to come to agreements with all employees.</strong> You will still profit from the wage arrangements you make with the other workers, and you will still be paid for the HIT. You cannot agree to a wage above the $9 budget.</p>
