<p>The employees are all here, their bids were:</p>

<div class="instructions well well-lg">
Employee 1 : <span id="e1">{{player.get_employee1.bid}}</span><br>
Employee 2 : <span id="e2">{{player.get_employee2.bid}}</span><br>
Employee 3 : <span id="e3">{{player.get_employee3.bid}}</span>
</div>

<p>Please negotiate with the employees and enter the agreed-to amount (for 5 pages) in the corresponding box below. Remember, we have a budget of $5 for every page that is completed at >95% accuracy, up to $25 for the 5 pages. (But we will pay out for each completed page). So for any bids less than $25, we'll give the rest of the money to you.</p>

<p>Example: Employee #1 bids $20 ($4 per page) and completes 3 pages at 100% accuracy and 2 at 70%.</p>
<p>In this case Employee #1 will be paid 3 x $4 = $12 and you will be paid the rest of the $5 budget for each completed page = 3 x ($5 - $4) = $3</p>
