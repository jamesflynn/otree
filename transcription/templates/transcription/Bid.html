    Bid for Work

<p><strong>All payoffs are real. You will be paid via an MTurk bonus.</strong></p>
<p>You have been assigned to be a Worker. You will decide how to split the budget with a Manager by negotiating. If you do not reach an agreement, neither you nor the manager will receive additional payments.</p>

<p>All workers have a random tax between $2 and $4.</p><p>Your random tax is: <span style="background-color: ghostwhite; display: inline; font-family:courier">{{tax}}</span></p>

<p>This means your final payoff will be the amount you agree to with the Manager minus <span style="background-color: ghostwhite; display: inline; font-family:courier">{{tax}}</span>. No one besides you knows this tax.</p>

<p>We will now ask you for an opening bid. The manager will see this bid and may use it to negotiate with you on a final price.</p>
