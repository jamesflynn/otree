<p>Everyone is here. You, 2 other employees, and a manager.</p>

<p>Your initial bid to the manager was {{ bid }} for each page. You can renegotiate here in the chat room, but you must agree to a price in order to submit the transcription work for a bonus.  It is okay to disagree and exit. You will still be paid for the HIT.</p>

  If there is a discrepancy between what you enter and what the manager enters, then you will not receive a bonus for work completed. Please make sure you agree!
