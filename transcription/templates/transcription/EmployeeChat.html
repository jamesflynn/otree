<p>A manager is here.</p>
{% else %}
<p>Everyone is here. You, 2 other employees, and a manager.</p>
{% endif %}

<p>Your tax is {{ tax }}</p>

<p>You have been assigned to be a worker.  We sent your bid to the manager, and the manager has received a budget.  If you reach an agreement on a wage, your payoff is (the wage you agree to minus the $Y). The manager will receive (his/her budget minus the wage you agree to).  If you do not reach an agreement, you will not receive any additional payments, and the manager will not receive any portion of his/her budget for you.</p>

<p>This means that if you agree to a wage of $Z, you will receive $Z minus $Y, and the manager will receive an additional payment of (his/her budget - $Z)</p>

<p>This means that the minimum wage you can accept from the manager is $Y.</p>

<p>Your initial bid to the manager was {{ bid }} for each page. The manager is here to discuss it with you. If they don't show up you can click through to finish the HIT, but you will not receive the bonus payment.</p>

    <p>Please talk to the manager to find out if your bid was accepted or not.</p>

    <p><small>If your work does not achieve at least 95% accuracy, you will not be paid for that page. Selecting Done will end your chat session, you cannot come back. If you do not come to an agreement you will still be paid for the HIT. You will receive any additional payment owed via an MTurk Bonus</small></p>
