<p>You have been assigned to be a worker.</p>

<p>Recall, you have been personally assigned a tax of <span style="background-color: ghostwhite; display: inline; font-family:courier">{{tax}}</span>, which only you know, and may not be the same as the other workers. That means you will receive the amount you agree to below (“the wage”), minus the tax.</p>

<p>For example, if you agree to a wage of $4.50, you will receive <span style="background-color: ghostwhite; display: inline; font-family:courier">{{example}}</span>   ($4.50 - <span style="background-color: ghostwhite; display: inline; font-family:courier">{{tax}}</span>), and the manager will receive an additional payment of <i>their budget</i> - $4.50</p> 

<p>The minimum you can accept is <span style="background-color: ghostwhite; display: inline; font-family:courier">{{tax}}</span> which gives you a payoff of $0.00</p>

<p>Your initial bid to the manager was <span style="background-color: ghostwhite; display: inline; font-family:courier">{{bid}}</span>. The manager is here to discuss it with you. {% if split_chats %}{% else %}There are also 2 other workers in the chat room.{% endif %} If the manager doesn't show up you can click through to finish the HIT, but you will not receive the bonus payment.</p>

    {% chat nickname=player.chat_nickname channel=channel %}

    <p>Please talk to the manager to determine your payment.</p>

<p>    {% formfield player.emp_price label="What is the confirmed price you will be paid? Enter 0 if no deal reached." %}</p>


    <p><small>Clicking Done will end your chat session, you cannot come back. If you do not come to an agreement you will still be paid for the HIT. You will receive any additional payment owed via an MTurk Bonus</small></p>
