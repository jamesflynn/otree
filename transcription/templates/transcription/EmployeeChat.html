<p><strong>All payoffs are real. You will be paid via an MTurk bonus.</strong></p>
<p>You have been assigned to be a Worker. You will negotiate with the Manager to split the budget. The Manager has a budget between $3 and $5. If you do not reach an agreement, you will not receive additional payments.</p>

<p>All workers have a random tax between $2 and $4.</p><p>Your random tax is: <span style="background-color: ghostwhite; display: inline; font-family:courier">{{tax}}</span></p>

<p>Your final payoff will be the amount you agree to with the Manager minus <span style="background-color: ghostwhite; display: inline; font-family:courier">{{tax}}</span>. No one besides you knows this tax. You can keep this information private if you want, but the minimum you can accept is <span style="background-color: ghostwhite; display: inline; font-family:courier">{{tax}}</span>, to cover your tax.</p>

<p>The manager is here to negotiate with you. {% if split_chats %}There are also 2 other Workers in separate chat rooms talking to the same manager, just like you are. You do not need to agree to the same wage as the other Workers. {% else %}There are also 2 other Workers in the chat room.{% endif %} Your payoff <strong>does not depend on the other Workers reaching an agreement</strong>.</p>
    <p>Please talk to the manager to determine your payment.</p>

    {% chat nickname=player.chat_nickname channel=channel %}

<p>If the manager doesn't show up you can click through to finish the HIT.</p>

<p>    {% formfield player.emp_price label="What is the confirmed wage you will be paid?" %}</p>
<p>    {% formfield player.emp_nodeal label=" Check here if you cannot reach a deal." %}</p>


    <p><small>Clicking Done will end your chat session, you cannot come back. If you do not come to an agreement you will still be paid for the HIT.</small></p>
