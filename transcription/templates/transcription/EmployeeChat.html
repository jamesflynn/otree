<p>You are the Worker. Please chat with the manager. They will be here in a minute or two.</p>

<p>Your task is to negotiate a wage with the manager for the same transcription task we sampled earlier. You must agree to a wage per page with the manager in the chat room and both of you must indicate the same wage upon exiting the chat room in order to be paid.</p>

<p>The manager has a budget of more than {{ kickin }} per page that you transcribe. You are paid the amount you agree to with the manager, and the manager will receive the difference between his or her budget and the wage agreed to with you in the chat room. Also, any per page wage above {{ kickin }} will also be subject to a tax for the manager, meaning that the manager will have to pay an additional 200% for marginal increases above {{ kickin }}. For example if you agree on $4.20, your wage is $4.20 but the manager will have to pay a $0.60 tax, or pay a total of $4.80 per page.</p>

    {% endif %}

    <p>Please wait to talk to the manager to find out if your bid was accepted or not.</p>

    <p><small>If your work does not achieve at least 95% accuracy, you will not be paid for that page. Selecting Done will end your chat session, you cannot come back. If you do not come to an agreement you will still be paid for the HIT. You will receive any additional payment owed via an MTurk Bonus</small></p>
