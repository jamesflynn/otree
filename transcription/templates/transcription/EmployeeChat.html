<p><strong>All payoffs are real. You will be paid via an MTurk bonus.</strong></p>

<p>Rememeber you have been assigned a tax of <span style="background-color: ghostwhite; display: inline; font-family:courier">{{tax}}</span>, which only you know, and may not be the same as the other Workers. You can keep this information private if you want. You will receive the amount you agree to with the Manager, minus the tax.</p>

<p>The minimum you can accept is <span style="background-color: ghostwhite; display: inline; font-family:courier">{{tax}}</span>, to cover your tax.</p>

<p>Your initial bid to the manager was <span style="background-color: ghostwhite; display: inline; font-family:courier">{{bid}}</span>. The manager is here to discuss it with you. {% if split_chats %}There are also 2 other workers in separate chat rooms talking to the same manager, just like you are. You do not need to agree to the same wage as the other workers. {% else %}There are also 2 other workers in the chat room, you do not need to agree to the same wage as the other workers.{% endif %}</p>
    <p>Please talk to the manager to determine your payment.</p>
