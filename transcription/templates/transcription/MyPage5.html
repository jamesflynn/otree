<p>With the following set of questions, we want to find out how much you would pay to obtain this information about average cash buffer days.</p>
 
<p>Below you are presented with 5 hypothetical scenarios. In each scenario, you will be given the choice of either completing a page of transcription at 95% accuracy within 48 hours OR receiving $2 without any transcription 48 hours from now. The amount of money you will be offered in these scenarios is pre-determined. For instance, in Scenario 1, you will need to choose between transcribing 1 page for $3 dollars or receiving $2 48 hours late; and in Scenario 5, you will need to choose between transcribing 1 page for $7 or receiving $2.</p>
<p>
If you are one of the 20 lucky survey respondents selected at random, we will randomly pick one of these 5 scenarios, and carry it out. You should answer honestly, because one of your choices might happen.
</P>
