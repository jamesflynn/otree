    <p>
Thank you for expressing interest in managing our data entry task. This project is challenging to break up into small HITs, and <strong>we would like you to be available to transcribers while they complete the task - to answer or pass along questions that arise, and figure out a price to pay them. The whole process should take about 30 minutes, and we have paid previous MTurkers on average $10 for this.</strong> Below we ask questions about your preferred terms of service, and some background questions.   At any time you can withdraw from the survey and submit incomplete answers with no penalty.  If you choose to terminate prematurely, enter the word "decline" into the MTurk HIT and we will accept your answer and pay you for the HIT only.
