<p>Hello!   We're excited to work together with you.</p>

<p>We invite you to participate in a research study on wage negotiations.  The purpose is academic research about how the information in wage negotiations can affect the outcome.  You will be asked to read a page of instructions, complete a 2-5 minute survey. Then you will be asked to chat with another person to negotiate the price of an additional task.  The negotiation typically takes between 5-7 additional minutes. If you agree on a price to complete a task the average participant receives approximately $3-$5.  Your own pay will likely be different. Your payment is based on your actions. All subjects who complete the study will be paid.   </p>
