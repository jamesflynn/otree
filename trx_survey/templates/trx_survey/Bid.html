    Bid for Work
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}

<p>You will be assigned to be either a worker or a manager in an upcoming round of negotiations in a chatroom. There may be multiple workers in the chatroom, and the manager will be assigned a budget between $3 and $5, per worker.  You will decide how to split the budget between you by negotiating.  If you do not reach an agreement, neither of you will receive additional payments.</p>

<p>If you are assigned to be a worker, you have a random tax assigned to you of {{ tax }}.  That means  your final payoff will be the amount you agree to with the manager minus a tax of XX. No one besides you knows this tax.

<p>We will now ask you for an opening bid. If you are assigned to be a worker, the manager will see this bid and may use it to negotiate with you on a final price.</p>
