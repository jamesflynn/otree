    Bid for Work
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}

<p>You will be assigned to be a worker or a manager in a round of negotiations in a chatroom. You will decide how to split the budget between you by negotiating. If you do not reach an agreement, neither of you will receive additional payments.</p>

<p>You have a randomly-assigned tax of: <span style="background-color: ghostwhite; display: inline; font-family:courier">{{tax}}</span>.</p>

<p>This means if you are a worker in the upcoming negotiation, your final payoff will be the amount you agree to with the manager minus <span style="background-color: ghostwhite; display: inline; font-family:courier">{{tax}}</span>. No one besides you knows this tax.</p>

<p>We will now ask you for an opening bid. If you are assigned to be a worker, the manager will see this bid and may use it to negotiate with you on a final price.</p>
