        Instructions
    </h3>

    <p>
        You have been randomly and anonymously matched with another 2
        participants in an auction. Each of you is given 100 points to start.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before bidding, you will learn the value of the object to you. The
        value of the object differs from participant to participant and is
        randomly and independently drawn from 0 to 100 for each participant.
    </p>
    <p>
        At auction, you will privately submit one bid for the object. A bid
        can be anything from 0 to 100 points. The participant with the highest
        bid wins the object and pays the second highest bid. A random device
        will select the winner in the event of a tie bid and the winner will
        pay the highest bid other than her or his own bid.
    </p>
    <p>
        The payoff of the winner is calculated as (in points)<br/>
        <strong>
            Winnerâ€™s payoff = 100 + Private value of the object to the winner - Second highest bid
        </strong><br/>
        The payoffs for others are the initial 100 points.
    </p>
    <p>
        For your convenience, these instructions will remain available to you on all subsequent screens of this study.
